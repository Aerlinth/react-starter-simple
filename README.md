# Orten.io React starter - simple

This is a React starter for simple projects. Techniques include React/ES6 and CSS.

## Getting started

Use your terminal to navigated to the directory to where you downloaded this project. Then use
  the command `npm install` to install dependencies such as React, ReactDOM and Webpack. You only
  need to do that the first time you're running the project. Then use the command `npm run start`
  to start webpack dev server (which'll build your project and make it accessible in the browser).
  Once webpack is done (it stopped loading), visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
  to see your project.

The HTML used can be found in the file `webpack-dev-server-content-base/index.html`. The visible
  JavaScript is in `src/App/index.js`. If you're looking for `ReactDOM.render()`, it's in
  `src/index.js` along with some other stuff to make your life easier when developing.
